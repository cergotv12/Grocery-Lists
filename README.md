# Grocery Lists
Grocery Lists is a small project by me (@desvasicek)
I created this project to test my skills with javascript, css and html. I left it for a long time until I finally came back to it.

## Details

- "Section" creates a new section from your text in the text box
- "Add" creates a new item in your list
- You can have infinite items in a list
- Click an item to check it
- Type a number or use the up/down buttons to change quantity
- Click and drag items or sections to sort
- When in delete mode click an item to delete it.

## Coming Soon
- Better styling
- Mobile website (maybe? :shrug:)
- Updated javascript (hopefully)
## Help
