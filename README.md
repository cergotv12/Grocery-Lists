## What this is
This is an archive of probably my best programs, put together to make awesomeness (A.K.A. Grocery Lists).

I highly encourage coding, as it is a challenge, but also very fun.

Grocery Lists is a small project by me ([@desvasicek](https://github.com/desvasicek))
I created this project to test my skills with javascript, css and html. I left it for a long time until I finally came back to it.
